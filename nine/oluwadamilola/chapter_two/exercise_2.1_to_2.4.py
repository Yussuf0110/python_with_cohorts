# x = 2

#(Whatâ€™s wrong with this code?) The following code \
# should read an integer into the variable rating :

#rating = input('Enter an integer rating between 1 and 10: ')

#The code is not reading an integer because inputs read \
# strings and it needs to be casted to int as in:
#Answer
# rating =  int(input('Enter an integer rating between 1 and 10'))

#2.3
#(Fill in the missing code) Replace *** in the following code with a statement that
# will print a message like 'Congratulations! Your grade of 91 earns you an A in this
# course' . Your statement should print the value stored in the variable grade :
# if grade >= 90:
# ***
# Answer
# grade = 91
# if grade >= 90:
#     print("Congratulations! Your grade of ", grade, " earns you an A in this course")

#value of an expression with 27.5 as the left operand and 2 as the right operand.
